# Transformers Layer

This layers help exist between **services** and **UI** components. Once data is fetched within the services layer, it is directed to the Transformers layer. Here, the data undergoes validation and checks to ensure it is in the correct format before being forwarded to the UI layer.

The Transformers layer serves as a protective barrier, helping to prevent backend-related issues that might arise in the future. By validating and formatting data before it reaches the UI, we can maintain a more stable and reliable application.
