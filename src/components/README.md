# Component Structure Guidelines
## Reusable Components
All reusable components should be organized in the src/components/Base folder. These components are designed to be shared across multiple pages and sections of the application. By keeping them in the Base folder, we promote code reusability and maintainability.

## Page-Specific Components
Components that are specific to a particular page or section of the application should be placed within the respective page folder under src/components.
