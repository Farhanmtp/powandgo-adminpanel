            Powandgo&apos;s mission is to revolutionize the electric mobility
            sector by offering an innovative and accessible platform for sharing
            charging points. We are committed to facilitating the adoption of
            electric vehicles through an extensive network of private charging
            stations, making the process more convenient, efficient, and
            sustainable. We aim to build a future where every electric vehicle
            owner can easily find a charging point, wherever they are, reducing
            range anxiety and promoting a greener lifestyle. Working with
            companies, public entities, and communities, Powandgo aspires to be
            at the center of an electric mobility ecosystem that values
            renewable energies, supports the ecological transition, and actively
            contributes to the fight against climate change. Our vision is of an
            interconnected society where the sharing of energy resources becomes

                The processing of collected personal data is carried out by
                authorized personnel using computerized systems that ensure
                adequate security measures to prevent data loss, unlawful or
                incorrect use, and unauthorized access.
              </p>{' '}
              <p>
                The processing is performed using automated tools (e.g., using
                electronic procedures and supports) and/or manually (e.g., on
                paper) for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes
                for which the data has been collected. In any case, specific
                security measures are adopted to prevent any breach of personal
                data, such as data loss, unlawful or incorrect use, and
                unauthorized access.
              </p>

                of unauthorized access or dispersion of data. To this end, it is

                as updated antivirus systems), and that the Internet service
